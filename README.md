# 42 project - ft_containers

## Our own implemetation of the C++ containers.

This project's goal was to re-implement 4 c++ containers : ``stack``, ``vector``, ``map`` and ``set``.

We had to implement them in c++98 only and take the structure of each standard container as reference. 
We also had to implement a red-black tree structure to be as effective as the standard map and set containers.
### How to run the program 

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shikalou/ft_containers.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd ft_containers/
```
MAKE
```bash
  make
```
Run the program
```bash
  ./ft_containers
```
You can test the different containers by changing the ``SRCS_FILES`` variable in the Makefile for one of the other main.cpp available in the srcs/ folder, simply comment or uncomment which line you want !
